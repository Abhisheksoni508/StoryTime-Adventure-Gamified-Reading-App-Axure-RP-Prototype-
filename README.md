# StoryTime Adventure — Gamified Reading App (Axure RP Prototype)

A children’s reading app prototype that rewards daily reading with **stars, streaks, and badges**.  
Built for an HCI coursework project to demonstrate **Don Norman’s six design principles**, **gamification**, and **child–computer interaction**.

> Prototype tool: **Axure RP 10**  
> Target users: **Children aged 4–12**

---

## ✨ Overview

**StoryTime Adventure** turns reading into a habit through playful feedback and visible progress:
- ⭐ Stars for completing story pages
- 🔥 Reading streaks to encourage daily use
- 🏅 Badges for milestones (e.g., “Daily Reader”, “Quiz Master”)

The prototype demonstrates:
- Visibility, Feedback, Constraints, Mapping, Consistency, Affordance
- Age-appropriate UI (large tap targets, simple language, friendly iconography)
- Motivational loops (read → quiz → reward → progress)

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Home**: Three clear CTAs (Read Story, My Profile, Rewards) + streak panel  
- **Story Selection**: Filter chips + tappable story cards with mini progress  
- **Story Reading**: Paged reading with progress bar and “Next Page” flow  
- **Quiz**: One-select radio groups per question + instant green/red feedback  
- **Results**: “You got X/3!” celebratory modal  
- **Rewards**: Badge grid (Earned / In Progress) + next-badge progress  
- **Profile**: Stars total, streak length, badges, favourites, level bar

## 📸 Screens (add your screenshots)

Create a `/screenshots` folder and add 5 images:

- `home.png` — visibility, consistency, affordance  
- `story_selection.png` — mapping & card affordance  
- `story_reading.png` — progress bar, constraints (Next →)  
- `quiz_feedback.png` — immediate feedback, single-select grouping  
- `rewards.png` — badge status visibility, motivation

---

## 🧠 HCI Rationale (short)

- **Visibility:** page counter, streak, badge status labels  
- **Feedback:** green/red quiz states; “Great Job!” / “Congratulations” messages  
- **Constraints:** single-select radio groups; linear reading → quiz → results flow  
- **Mapping:** consistent left/back arrow; “Tap to Read” placed on the card it opens  
- **Consistency:** same button style, colours, typography across screens  
- **Affordance (signifiers):** raised rounded buttons; shadowed cards; clear labels

**Gamification:** stars, streaks, badges (Deterding; Hamari) aligned with **Self-Determination Theory** (Deci & Ryan): autonomy (story choice), competence (quiz), relatedness (share progress).

---

## 🔬 Research Plan (prototype-as-artifact)

**Question:** Do stars/badges increase motivation vs. a non-gamified version?  
**Design:** within-subjects (A: gamified / B: plain), counterbalanced  
**Participants:** 10–12 children (4–12) with parental consent  
**Measures:** time-on-task, stories completed, quiz score; short smiley-scale enjoyment + brief interview  
**Analysis:** paired t-test (quant), thematic analysis (qual)  
**Ethics:** consent/assent, anonymity, age-appropriate language, safe data practices

---

## ♿ Accessibility (in scope for future)

- High-contrast button text on colour cards  
- Optional **read-aloud narration** and larger type presets  
- Dyslexia-friendly font option and increased line spacing  
- Alt text for all figures in documentation
